rem Tack static bogus IPv6 addresses onto every interface, so at least Firefox will work out of the box.
rem Rather than actually try and see what interfaces exist/are good/will be up on ethernet vs wifi, we just throw addresses at the first 100.
rem See <http://student.agh.edu.pl/~ksztand/2015/12/dns-fix-for-windows/>.

echo Adding fake IPv6 addresses, please wait...

rem Skip 1 because that's loopback.
FOR /L %%N IN (2,1,100) DO (netsh interface ipv6 add address %%N fd42:562a:6d05::%%N/48) > NUL

echo DNS patch applied!
